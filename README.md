# cifar10_vanishing_gradients.py
Vanishing Gradient Experiment in Deep CNNs (PyTorch, CIFAR-10) A comparative study of Sigmoid vs ReLU activation functions in a 4-layer convolutional neural network. Includes training curves, per-layer gradient flow analysis, and activation gradient heatmaps to visualize vanishing gradients in deep networks.
